FuzzyTimeFR
===========
This watchface is based on the Fuzzy French Plus watchface by mandla, and on the 91-Dub-v2.0 by orviwan for the configuration page.

As you can see on the pictures, the time is set fuzzy, you have time at 5 minutes near.

The number of line is automagically adapted in fonction of the text to show (3 lines on the 1st pictures, 4 lines on the 2nd).

You can personnalize the watch with somes options :
- Precise Minute : show the real minute in the upper right corner.
-Color : you can invert the color (like the 3rd picture).
-Battery : you can show the battery of the watch in the upper left corner
-Date : you can show/hide the date

Known bugs :
- Your configuration might take times to show up.
- the "midi" line is not bold.  Will be corrected soon

Future plan :
- correct bugs
- rewrite the fuzzy_time() function : create something more general, wich can lead up to internationalization of the watchface.
- moar options ! :)
